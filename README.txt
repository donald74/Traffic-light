This program propose a solution to control a system light with 3 lane. 
The second lane is activated when a car is present and the sensor(Button) is activated.
The light on the principal lane are set to green until the sensor(button click) and a car is present.
When that occur(sensor actviate) the light change and permit the car to pass and the system continue, 
until a new event occur.

This can be upgrade to attempt a more clair and high vision(3D) of the system.

This can be used freely without any problem, just mention the contribution.
